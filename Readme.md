# MVHS Club Website 
## About
This website scrapes data from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qi6KNjkR5NHE6uauEtOWDnILqzJF5raC0ST38Au1s9s/edit#gid=503978023) and displays it in a readable format, sorted by the club meeting time. It does not scrape data in real time, but does so periodically because otherwise we would need to require students to log in in order to work. 
## Stack
This website uses vue 3 with vite and a static JSON file to store the class data.
