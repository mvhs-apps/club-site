Around the world, there are a total of 257 million people infected with the Hepatitis B virus. Although effectively 'cured' 25 years ago, the vaccine and treatment has yet to be properly implemented, with only 10% of all cases knowing their diagnosis. Hepatitis B, typically transmitted by birth, will usually not cause symptoms until the patient is about 30 years old, when liver cancer and cirrhosis strikes out of nowhere, abrupting their otherwise seemingly healthy lives, totaling close to a million deaths annually. A silent killer, the virus is also highly stigmatized, with many infected taking their own lives due to their lack of knowledge about the disease or due to ignorant discrimination. Team HBV, a program spearheaded by the Stanford Asian Liver Center and its Beijing counterpart, seek to raise awareness of the disease, lower stigma, and get people screened and treated. With a movement endorsed specifically by Jackie Chan for a purpose recognized by President Obama, we could effectively eradicate the disease by 2030 - together. #JoinJade. As a club, we plan on attending various outreach and service events related to and/or associated with the #JoinJade movement, including the Youth Leadership Conference and the Chinese New Year Parade in downtown SF, as well as fundraising.
